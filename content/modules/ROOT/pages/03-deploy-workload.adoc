= Deploy a sample pod

Now that the everything is ready, we can run a sample workload.
Let's first see what we can and must add into the pod yaml to make it run in a VM.

NOTE: Because of CPU Quota limitations of this ARO subscription, and since each CoCo runs in a Confidential VM, you are just allowed to get **one single CoCo pod** at time. Trying to deploy a second one will result in failure and container stuck in `ContainerCreating` state.

In this section, we will show you two simple examples of how to respectively enable CoCo in a traditional pod and how to perform attestation. Please refer to the xref:04-conclusion.adoc[next section] to learn about more complex examples with AI, gpus, and so on.

[#options]
== Available options

=== Mandatory options
In order to run a pod in a VM, it is mandatory to specify the `runtimeClassName` field in the pod `spec`. For peer-pods, the runtime class is called `kata-remote`.

[source,yaml,role=execute]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: <Pod>
# ...
spec:
  runtimeClassName: kata-remote
# ...
----

=== Optionals

* Add an annotation to the pod-templated object to use a manually defined instance size or an automatic instance size:
+
[source,yaml,role=execute]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: <Pod>
metadata:
  annotations:
    io.katacontainers.config.hypervisor.machine_type: Standard_D32as_v5
# ...
----
+
Note that the `machine_type` must be one of the one specified in `AZURE_INSTANCE_SIZES` or `AZURE_INSTANCE_SIZE` in the OSC xref:02-configure-osc.adoc#pp-cm[ConfigMap]. By default, all instance types will be `AZURE_INSTANCE_SIZE`.

* Define the amount of memory available for the workload to use. The workload will run on an automatic instance size based on the amount of memory available.
+
[source,yaml,role=execute]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: <Pod>
metadata:
  annotations:
    io.katacontainers.config.hypervisor.default_vcpus: <vcpus>
    io.katacontainers.config.hypervisor.default_memory: <memory>
# ...
----

* Relax the default policy to enable logs and/or exec. A Confidential Container doesn't enable by default logging or exec into the pod, otherwise a malicious actor (oc admin) could be able to enter and see the secrets. For the purpose of this workshop, it is possible to enable logs using an https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/blob/main/docs/how-to/how-to-use-the-kata-agent-policy.md#encode-a-policy-file[alternative Kata policy, window=blank].
+
A Kata policy is defined as `io.katacontainers.config.agent.policy` under `annotation` in the pod yaml, and it's base64 encoded. It defines what a CoCo pod is allowed to do and not.
+
For example the https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/blob/main/src/kata-opa/allow-all-except-exec-process.rego[allow-all-except-exec-process.rego, window=blank] enables pod logs while keeping exec disabled.
+
If we want to allow exec (but not logs), we can simply download that file and convert it to base64:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/refs/heads/main/src/kata-opa/allow-all-except-exec-process.rego | base64
----
+
And it can be provided to any CoCo pod by adding it as `metadata:annotations:io.katacontainers.config.agent.policy`:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: policy-exec-rejected
  annotations:
    io.katacontainers.config.agent.policy: cGFja2....
...
----
+
This is a generic template for a policy:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]

cat default-osc-policy.yaml
----
+
The main two switches in the policy are `ReadStreamRequest` and `ExecProcessRequest`. The former enables logs, and the latter exec. Note that if `ExecProcessRequest` is enabled, but `ReadStreamRequest` is not, the user can still inject commands, but won't be able to see the output. **This does not mean the command won't be executed**.
+
This policy shows that is also possible to define some specific `exec` commands by defining `ExecProcessRequest if {}` and `policy_data := {}` functions and leaving `ExecProcessRequest` to `false`. In this case it only allows the command `curl http://127.0.0.1:8006/cdh/resource/default/kbsres1/key1`. What this means is that the defined command will work, but **any** other command will fail. Even `oc exec -it pods/your_pod -- curl` will not work.
+
This is extremely useful if the pod has to provide restricted access to an untrusted actor (admin, developer) to for example debug the application logic inside the confidential container.
+
If limiting exec commands is not important, the whole `ExecProcessRequest if {}` and `policy_data := {}` can be safely deleted from the policy, and as long as `ExecProcessRequest` is `true`, any exec command will be allowed to run.
+
Once the policy has been customized, translate it in `base64`:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
cat default-osc-policy.yaml | base64
----
+
And then add it to `metadata:annotations:io.katacontainers.config.agent.policy`.

[#example]
== Hello world example

In this example we will show how easy is to modify an existing pod to make it running in CoCo, i.e. specifying the `runtimeclass` in the podspec. No other action is necessary w.r.t the pod itself, and the confidential VM is completely transparent to it.

This is a sample yaml that runs an `hello-openshift` pod in the `default` namespace. The pod application is not developed by the CoCo team, nor was modified purposefully for this example. The code is available https://github.com/openshift-for-developers/hello[here, window=blank]. This pod creates a server and outputs `"Hello Openshift!"` every time it is reached. The difference between this pod deployed as confidential container and traditional pod is just that the former has `spec.runtimeClassName: kata-remote` defined in the pod spec.

. Create and apply the yaml file.

[#verify]
== Verify that the pod is running in a VM
How to be sure that all what we did so far is actually running in a VM? There are several ways to check this.

We can check via command line using `az`.

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
az vm list --query "[].{Name:name, VMSize:hardwareProfile.vmSize}" --output table
----

Example output:

[source,texinfo,subs="attributes"]
----

bastion-q5hqf                                 Standard_DS1_v2
----

Look at the various VMs. You will see there are:

* 3 masters VM (called _aro-cluster-{guid}-<random chars>-master-0/1/2_)
* 3 workers VM (called _aro-cluster-{guid}-<random chars>-worker-<region>-<random chars>_)
* 1 _bastion-{guid}_ VM, used internally by the workshop infrastructure. The console on the right is actually connected to this VM, and all commands are being performed from here.
* 1 **podvm-hello-openshift-<random chars>**. This is where the `hello-openshift` pod is actually running! Note also how the instance tyoe under `Size` column at the right side is not the same as the other VMs. It is indeed `Standard_D8as_v5`, as specified in the OSC xref:02-configure-osc.adoc#pp-cm[ConfigMap].

[#verify-security]
== Verify the CoCo pod security restrictions
This `hello-openshift` test pod runs under the default OSC policy, therefore logs and exec are disabled by default.

. Check that logs are disabled
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc logs pods/hello-openshift
----
+
And notice how no log is printed. This is because of the default Kata policy disallows that.
+
NOTE: if you used https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/blob/main/src/kata-opa/allow-all-except-exec-process.rego[allow-all-except-exec-process.rego, window=blank], logs would be visible. As an exercise (not suitable for production), try to deploy the same `sample-openshift.yaml` with the custom policy, and see how the log works.

. Check that pod exec is disabled
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc exec -it pods/hello-openshift -- bash
----
+
And notice how an error is returned:
+
[source,texinfo,subs="attributes"]
----
error: Internal error occurred: error executing command in container: cannot enter container 8c0001fb69f7b8e728a3ccc8ad51d362f284f17450765f895db91dce7fc00413, with err rpc error: code = PermissionDenied desc = "ExecProcessRequest is blocked by policy: ": unknown
----

. Check that ssh'ing into the pod Confidential VM is disabled.
+
There are multiple ways to accomplish this, for example using the ssh key created when xref:02-configure-osc.adoc#pp-key[setting up the ssh key in OSC]. If `id_rsa` is not destroyed, it could be used to try and ssh into the VM. However, such attempt will fail, as the VM does not accept any SSH incoming connection.

[#example-att]
== Attestation with strict exec policy example

In this example you will try how the attestation mechanism works, and how easy is to trigger it to get a secret.

IMPORTANT: If you are following this guide in order, make sure that the `hello-openshift` pod has been fully terminated before running this next one, otherwise you will run into quota issues related to the Azure subscription.

The `ocp-cc-pod` by itself is simply a CoCo pod that sleeps for an hour and then dies. The particularity is that has a more relaxed Kata policy, so we are able to exec into it and be able to manually trigger attestation to fetch a secret.

. Since this is the only command allowed, `exec` to get the Trustee `key1` secret into the pod. This key was added in Trustee when xref:02-configure-trustee.adoc#trustee-key[configuring it]. If you followed the exact instructions, `key1` was configured to contain `Confidential_Secret!`.

----
+
IMPORTANT: Notice how the `curl` call is connecting with `http://127.0.0.1`. This is done on purpose, because the CoCo technology is designed to avoid hardcoding any special logic into the pod application. This means that a confidential container doesn't have to know where the Trustee lives, what is its ip, or even care about the attestation report. This is provided in the OSC `AA_KBC_PARAMS` given in the xref:02-configure-osc.adoc#pp-cm[peer-pods configmap]. Such url is then forwarded to the local `Trustee agent` running in side the CoCo Confidential VM automatically, so all the CoCo pod application has to do is communicate **locally** (therefore `http` is enough) with the local `Trustee agent` and ask for the path representing the secret it would like to get, in this case `kbsres1/key1`. The `Trustee agent` will then take care of collecting hardware & software attestation proofs, create an attestation report, enstablish an `https` connection with the remote attester `Trustee operator`, and then perform the attestation process.

. Trying any other command in `exec` will fail.

[#destroy]
== Destroy the example pods
The pods created in this example section are no different from any other pod, therefore it can be destroyed just as the others (via command line, web ui, etc.). Behind the scenes, the operator will make sure that the created VM will also be completely deallocated.
