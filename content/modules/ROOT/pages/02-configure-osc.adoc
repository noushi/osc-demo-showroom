= Configure the OSC operator

Now that the OSC operator is installed, we need to set it up.

**Prerequisites**

To complete this section, it is mandatory to have all ARO credentials at hand defined in the xref:index.adoc#credentials[introduction], because they will have to be inserted in the various resources that we are going to create.

In order to create the xref:02-configure-osc.adoc#pp-cm[peer-pods configmap], it is necessary to have Trustee xref:01-install-trustee.adoc#twebui[installed] and xref:02-configure-trustee.adoc#trustee-route[configured].

[#pp-secret]
== Create the peer-pods secret
The OSC operator must have access to the ARO credentials in order to create VMs.

Currently we are using the azure-credentials secret from the kube-system namespace which has the required permissions to call Azure API to create VM, fetch images, join networks, create image gallery and definition in the ARO managed group.

. Get the necessary credentials.

IMPORTANT: Note the `AZURE_INSTANCE_SIZES` field. This field is used to specify additional instance sizes that the operator should support. By default, if not specified all new pod VM will be of type `AZURE_INSTANCE_SIZE`, but if specified in the pod yaml (see xref:03-deploy-worload.adoc#options[here]), it will use one of the types indicated in `AZURE_INSTANCE_SIZES`.
Azure instance types are explained and listed https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/overview?tabs=breakdownseries%2Cgeneralsizelist%2Ccomputesizelist%2Cmemorysizelist%2Cstoragesizelist%2Cgpusizelist%2Cfpgasizelist%2Chpcsizelist[here, window=blank].

It is also worth pointing the azure terminology for instances: the pattern is usually `Standard_X{C}{num_cpus}{a or e}xx_vx` where `C` stands for **Confidential**, `a` for CPUs using **AMD SEV/SNP** technology, and `e` for CPUs using **Intel TDX** technology. Therefore `Standard_DC8_es_v5` is a confidential instance with 8 Intel CPUs using TDX to provide data in use confidentiality.

For this example, we are going to deploy AMD cpus, because they are available in all regions. If you want to deploy a TDX instance, check the region availability (usually `northeurope` is a good choice) and deploy a new workshop in that region.

oc apply -f pp-cm.yaml

NOTE: As you might have noticed, `AZURE_IMAGE_ID` is purposefully left empty. It will be filled in automatically by a Job created by the operator later.

[NOTE]
====
If you later update the peer pods config map, you must restart the peerpodconfig-ctrl-caa-daemon daemonset to apply the changes.
After you update the config map, apply the manifest. Then restart the cloud-api-adaptor pods by running the following command:
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc set env ds/peerpodconfig-ctrl-caa-daemon -n openshift-sandboxed-containers-operator REBOOT="$(date)"
----
Keep in mind that restarting the daemonset recreates the peer pods, it does not update the existing pods

[#pp-key]
== Create the peer-pods SSH key
When CoCo mode is disabled (so the VM is not confidential), this key is also useful to enter the pod VM, inspect it and debug. In CoCo, ssh into the VM is disabled by default. We need to create it anyways because an SSH key is required to create Azure VMs, but as we will see, it will be discarded immediately.

. Create an ssh key:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
ssh-keygen -f ./id_rsa -N ""
----

. Upload `id_rsa.pub` as `Secret` into Openshift.
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc create secret generic ssh-key-secret -n openshift-sandboxed-containers-operator --from-file=id_rsa.pub=./id_rsa.pub
----
. Once the public key is uploaded, delete both private and public from the local setup.
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
shred --remove id_rsa.pub id_rsa
----

[#pp-kc]
== Create the peer-pods KataConfig

You must create a `KataConfig` custom resource (CR) to install `kata-remote` as a runtime class on your worker nodes. This is a core operation that enables the worker nodes to create VMs.

Creating the `KataConfig` CR triggers the Openshift sandboxed containers Operator to create a `RuntimeClass` CR named `kata-remote` with a default configuration. This enables users to configure workloads to use `kata-remote` as the runtime by referencing the CR in the `RuntimeClassName` field. This CR also specifies the resource overhead for the runtime.

Openshift sandboxed containers installs `kata-remote` as a _secondary, optional_ runtime on the cluster and not as the primary runtime.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Creating the KataConfig CR automatically reboots the worker nodes. According with the documentation, the reboot can take from 10 to more than 60 minutes. **In this ARO workshop, it should take around 15 minutes**. Factors that impede reboot time are as follows:

* A larger Openshift Container Platform deployment with a greater number of worker nodes.
* Activation of the BIOS and Diagnostics utility.
* Deployment on a hard disk drive rather than an SSD.
* Deployment on physical nodes such as bare metal, rather than on virtual nodes.
* A slow CPU and network.
====

. Create a KataConfig CDR and apply it. By default all worker nodes will be configured to run CoCo workloads. If you want to restrict it to specific worker nodes, then add any specific label to those worker does and update the `kataconfigPoolSelector`. For this workshop, it is not needed to add any label.

. Wait for kata-oc `MachineConfigPool` (MCP) to be in `UPDATED` state (once `UPDATEDMACHINECOUNT` equals `MACHINECOUNT`). In this ARO setup with 3 worker nodes, it should take around 15 minutes.

=== Verification
. Make sure that the `AZURE_IMAGE_ID` in the `ConfigMap` is populated. If it isn't, make sure there is a job running called `osc-podvm-image-creation-<random-letters>`.
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc get configmap peer-pods-cm -n openshift-sandboxed-containers-operator -o yaml
----
+
If `AZURE_IMAGE_ID` is still empty, check the job:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
watch oc get pods -n openshift-sandboxed-containers-operator
----
+
Wait till the job `STATUS` doesn't change to `Completed`. In this ARO setup, it should take around 15 minutes.


. Make sure that the required daemonset is created.
